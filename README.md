# Code-Convertible Password Generator
About this is project: I created the password generator using this is all javascript, HTML and CSS.
I started with using variables, functions and conditions correctly. I organized the event handlers. Given a starter code and use the best methods such stringfly() and parse() and others, It is simply good to remember that you have to add the start button and the function to run the password. I used game logic to know how that functions fit in the code. 

# Motivation(s)
My motivation: I would like to build my craft of registering clients
and know them. Also, another motivation is to be cleaner and 
consistent with code in using the password generator. 

# Technologies used
